# Rapid evolution of innate immunity revealed by species-biased responses to bacteria in Drosophila


This repository contains scripts and data to support the paper.

## Scripts

bacterial_load.R
- plot bacterial load at day 1.

survival_curve.R
- plot a survival curve with survival data using Kaplan-Meier estimate.

bacterial_load_correlation_with_survival.ipynb
- do a correlaton between bacterial load and survival considering phylogenetic relationships.


## Data
groups_g.txt
- orthomcl results in orthologous gene clusters

combined_res_singlecopy_ef.txt
- combined result table from Deseq2 comparing untreated vs bacteria-infected, converting gene ID in non-dmel to corresponding gene ID in dmel from E. faecalis dataset

combined_res_singlecopy_pr.txt
- combined result table from Deseq2 comparing untreated vs bacteria-infected, converting gene ID in non-dmel to corresponding gene ID in dmel from P. rettgeri dataset
